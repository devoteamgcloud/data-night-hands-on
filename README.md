# Data Night

Welcome to the data night!

In this repository, you will find the code for two sessions:

## Building an ML model using Vertex AI pipelines
In this session we will develop and deploy a Vertex AI Pipeline that will train a regression model using AutoML.
You can find this code in the kfp_vertex_ai_pipeline_example folder.

## Building a Datflow pipeline for ML Inference
In this session we will develop and depoy a Dataflow pipeline that will call the model we just built to perform
ML inference.
